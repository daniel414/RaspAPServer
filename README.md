## Install RaspAP

Begin with a clean install of the latest release of a supported Linux distribution.
```
ssh daniel@192.168.1.26
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get full-upgrade
sudo reboot
```

Invoke RaspAP's Quick Installer, and install with default settings (y)
```
curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash
```

Following a reboot, the wireless AP network will be configured as follows:
```
IP address: 10.3.141.1
Username: admin
Password: secret
DHCP range: 10.3.141.50 — 10.3.141.255
SSID: raspi-webgui
Password: ChangeMe
```
It is strongly recommended that you change these default credentials in RaspAP's Authentication and Hotspot > Security panels.
